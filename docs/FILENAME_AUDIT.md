# Filename Audit

Scope: projects/quiet_arbiter folder.

## Findings
- Removed legacy demo naming and old artifacts.

## Rationale
- Keep file naming aligned to the Rust-first engine and latency-first goals.

## Keys and Secrets
- No API keys or secrets found in filenames.
- Avoid placing secrets in docs or code; keep local-only config outside repo.

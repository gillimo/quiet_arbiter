# Project Vision

Build a Rust-first, low-latency Polymarket arbitrage engine where latency is the first gate. The system hunts long-tail mispricings, executes two-leg trades with strict risk controls, and proves positive EV through auditable logs and iteration. If the latency budget is breached, no trade is attempted. No LLMs in the hot path.

Purpose: define how to run the quiet_arbiter project and how to sign work.

- Project scope: `OneDrive/Desktop/projects/quiet_arbiter`.
- Sign-in: register in `docs/LOGBOOK.md` before edits; sign docs/logs with handle + date.
- Entry points:
  - CLI: `cargo run --manifest-path core/Cargo.toml -- <command>`
- Logs: write to `logs/run_*.jsonl` when enabled.
- Data: editable stubs live in `data/` (state, reference data, risk limits, strategies).
